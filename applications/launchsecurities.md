## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

I've proposed ideas in the past and felt like I have been slightly let down by the Poly team responses so I am not going to spend a great deal of time filling out this application unless I recieve an indication of interest to do so. The two ideas that I have brought up in the past are:
1.) Gust Launch for Security Tokens. The end goal is a plain vanilla, SEC approved security launch process at an affordable cost to users. I have a local incubator who has indicated interest to invest in me if I do this but they wanted too much equity. Perhaps if I approacehd them with a grant as well I would have leverage towards more favorable equity negotiations. 
2.) Edgar for Security Tokens. There are a lot of information dynamics at play with securities. If security tokens want to have any degree of fairness there need to be rules surrounding the sharing of information. I would like to create a centralized platform to do so.
